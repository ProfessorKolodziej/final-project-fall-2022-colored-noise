				<a href="homepage.html">Colored noise is like having a favorite crayon box -
					it's a mix of sounds, but some frequencies are more vibrant than others. So, if white noise is the
					sound of all the crayons equally, colored noise is like saying, "Hey, let's use more of the blue and
					green crayons in our drawing today! It's a fun way to think about how sounds come together in
					different ways.</a>
